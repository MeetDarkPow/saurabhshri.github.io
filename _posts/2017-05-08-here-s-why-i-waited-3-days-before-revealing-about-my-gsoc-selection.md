I got accepted into Google Summer of Code 2017, the result of which was announced on May 4th. I did not tell anyone about this until yesterday, here's why!

While I had been preparing for GSoC since November, no one in my vicinity knew about it. It wasn't a very big secret and I had no major reason for hiding it - except for the fact I did not want to get disctracted by the thoughts of what my friends and peers were thinking about it and the constant questioning that would have risen. Working quitely gave me the benefit of remaining focussed and working without any burden of people's opinions and expectations. It also gave me an amazing opprtunity to surprise my family and closed ones when I finally got accepted into GSoC. I will definitley write about that and update this post with link to it. So visit again some time later if you are interested in reading that.

The thing is, when I decided to try for GSoC (it was around November previous year), I made a promise to myself that my mother would be the fisrt person I tell about this if I get accepted. The problem was, when the result was announced, I was amidst my semester examinations. I sure did not want to miss my mother's expression by telling her over the phone, I wanted to be _there_ when I tell her this. So, even being the blabber-mouth I am, I somehow had to keep this news to myself.

When the result was announced, I rushed out of room with my laptop and cell-phone to another college building, because there were lot of people in my room at that time. I sat there and logged into the dashboard to find this amazing news. :) I immediately had the conversation regarding the same with the community and then went back to my room to prepare for next exam.

My exams finally ended on 6th May, and I took the morning train to home the immediate next day! I had arranged a surprise announcement for my  family and friends and then I finally told my parents about my selection. I would like to thank everyone for their wishes and compliments and I am really sorry to everyone because I did not tell you all earlier about this. But I hope you understand the reason now.

I finally published the long-due post about me getting accepted into GSoC prior to this post (read that [here](https://saurabhshri.github.io/2017/05/gsoc/accepted-in-google-summer-of-code-2017 "Getting accepted into GSoC.")) and now that I am home, it's time to get to work as per my proposed timeline! :)
