Community bonding period, where students spend time learning and getting ready for their project, ends on 30th of May.

The Google Summer of Code 2017 community bonding period began with the announcement of [accepted projects](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/) on 4th of May and will end tomorrow, on 30th of May. This will mark the **official** commencement of Coding Period, which will last for 3 months. Students shall begin writing code for their projects under their mentors based on the timeline and milestones they set during this community bonding period. First evaluations are scheduled to take place from 26th June till 30th June.
