Hello everybody! This blog will contain all the updates by me. I will try my best to update it regularly. Stay tuned!

I am Saurabh Shrivastava a 3rd year Information Technology Engineering undergrad at [IET DAVV, Indore](http://ietdavv.edu.in/), India. My interests lie in the field of computers. I was introduced to programming in 11th standard and scored a perfect 100 in my 12th Computer Science Board Examinations. I love programming in C and C++ and am constantly learning new things. 

I recently got introduced to the world of open source and I haven't looked back since. I absolutely love the idea of open source software and am thouroughly enjoying it. I am trying my part to [contribute](https://github.com/saurabhshri "My Github page.") as I learn :) It feels amazing to know that your contribution is _actually_ out there and people are using it. I also started competitive coding at [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/users/shubhshri "My CodeChef Account.") but haven't been active since sometime. I shall start again as and when I get time (should be soon after this semester ends).

You may read more about me in the __About Me__ section which I should be updating soon.

This blog post is basically to test this newly set up blog. You may read more about the details of blog set-up below :

- **Platform**: The blog is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with the help of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The blog was up in literally minutes without much hassle. 

- **Theme**: The theme is [Notepad](https://github.com/hmfaysal/Notepad) by [@hmfaysal](https://twitter.com/hmfaysal). I have always been a fan of plain and simple design.

- **Source**: You may find the source of this blog [here](github.com/saurabhshri/saurabhshri.github.io).


Thank you for reading! :) Comment here to share your suggestions.
